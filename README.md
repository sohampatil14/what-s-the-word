# what-s-the-word

A fun little application with lots to learn while improving vocabulary.

The main objective of this project is to understand the difficulties faced by people to communicate in a language and to select the perfect word for scenario.

Familiarizing people with better words than they used to use previously. 

If the words are provided with their synonyms, antonyms, meaning and way of use they will get remembered for longtime.

Our objective is to let people communicate effectively and have a great eloquence.

During formal communication, informal communication and public speaking people have the problem that they donâ€™t have sufficient dictions to communicate.

Either they shy away to talk or they talk in basic language. 

But through this project people can easily know perfect words in a quiz manner.

Hints are given and the user has to write the correct word.
